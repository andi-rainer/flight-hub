# Flight Log Warning System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of the flight log warning system that detects location disconnects and flight overlaps, allowing users to create entries despite warnings while flagging them for board review.

## Requirements Implemented

### 1. Location Disconnect Warning
- When creating a flight, the system checks if the departure ICAO code matches the destination ICAO code of the previous flight for the same aircraft on the same day or previous day
- If they don't match, displays: "Location disconnect: Previous flight landed at [LAST_ICAO] but new flight departs from [NEW_ICAO]"

### 2. Flight Overlap Warning
- Checks if the new flight times (block off to block on) overlap with any existing flight for the same aircraft on the same day
- If overlap detected, displays: "Flight overlap detected with another flight on [DATE]"

### 3. Allow Creation Despite Warnings
- Users can still create flights even with warnings present
- Confirmation modal shows warnings prominently with clear messaging

### 4. Flag for Board Review
- Flights created with warnings are marked with `needs_board_review = true`
- Notifications are automatically created for all board members
- Notifications link directly to the aircraft's flight log and the specific entry

## Files Modified

### 1. Database Migration
**File:** `/Users/andreas/Documents/Coding/Projects/SFC/flight-hub/supabase/migrations/20250125000000_add_flightlog_warnings.sql`

- Added `needs_board_review` boolean column to `flightlog` table
- Added `flightlog_id` reference column to `notifications` table
- Extended notification type enum to include flight warning types
- Added appropriate indexes for performance

**To Apply Migration:**
```bash
# Run migration on your Supabase instance
npx supabase db push

# OR if using remote database
npx supabase migration up
```

### 2. Database Types
**File:** `/Users/andreas/Documents/Coding/Projects/SFC/flight-hub/lib/database.types.ts`

- Updated `flightlog` table types to include `needs_board_review`
- Updated `notifications` table types to include `flightlog_id`
- Updated `flightlog_with_times` view to include `needs_board_review`

### 3. Server Actions
**File:** `/Users/andreas/Documents/Coding/Projects/SFC/flight-hub/app/(dashboard)/flightlog/actions.ts`

#### New Functions Added:

**`checkFlightWarnings()`**
- Checks for location disconnect by querying previous flights
- Checks for time overlap with existing flights
- Returns array of warnings with type and message

**`getBoardMembers()`**
- Fetches all users with 'board' role
- Used for creating notifications

#### Modified Function:

**`createFlightlog()`**
- Now accepts optional `overrideWarnings` flag and `warnings` array
- Sets `needs_board_review` flag when warnings are overridden
- Creates notifications for all board members when entry needs review
- Notifications include warning details and link to flight log

### 4. Flight Log Dialog
**File:** `/Users/andreas/Documents/Coding/Projects/SFC/flight-hub/app/(dashboard)/flightlog/[aircraftId]/components/flightlog-dialog.tsx`

- Added `flightWarnings` state to track detected warnings
- Modified `handleSubmit()` to call `checkFlightWarnings()` before showing confirmation
- Updated confirmation modal to display warnings prominently with Alert component
- Warnings shown with red alert styling and clear messaging
- Passes warnings to `createFlightlog()` when user confirms creation
- Shows success message indicating board notification when warnings are overridden

### 5. Flight Log List
**File:** `/Users/andreas/Documents/Coding/Projects/SFC/flight-hub/app/(dashboard)/flightlog/[aircraftId]/flightlog-content.tsx`

- Added visual indicator (red "Review" badge with AlertTriangle icon) for entries needing board review
- Badge displays prominently in the Status column
- Desktop shows "Review" text, mobile shows "!" icon

## User Flow

### Creating a Flight with Warnings

1. User fills out flight log form as normal
2. User clicks "Create" button
3. System performs validation checks (times, ICAO codes, etc.)
4. System checks for warnings:
   - Location disconnect (departure vs previous destination)
   - Flight overlap (time conflict with other flights)
5. Confirmation modal appears showing:
   - All calculated flight times
   - Any warnings detected (highlighted in red)
   - Clear message: "By continuing, this entry will be flagged for board review and all board members will be notified."
6. User can:
   - Click "Cancel" to go back and edit
   - Click "Create Entry" to proceed despite warnings
7. If warnings exist and user proceeds:
   - Flight is created with `needs_board_review = true`
   - Notifications are sent to all board members
   - User sees success message: "Flightlog entry created successfully. Board members have been notified for review."
8. Entry appears in list with red "Review" badge

### Board Member Experience

1. Board members receive notification
2. Notification message includes:
   - Aircraft tail number
   - List of all warnings
3. Notification links to aircraft's flight log page
4. Flight entry shows with red "Review" badge in list
5. Board members can click entry to view/edit details

## Warning Logic Details

### Location Disconnect Check
```
1. Get the most recent flight for the same aircraft
2. Search within same day or previous day
3. Compare previous flight's icao_destination with new flight's icao_departure
4. If mismatch detected, create warning
```

### Flight Overlap Check
```
1. Get all flights for same aircraft on same day
2. For each existing flight:
   - Check if new flight's block_off < existing flight's block_on
   - AND new flight's block_on > existing flight's block_off
3. If overlap detected, create warning with date
```

## Database Schema Changes

### flightlog table
```sql
ALTER TABLE flightlog
ADD COLUMN needs_board_review boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false;
```

### notifications table
```sql
ALTER TABLE notifications
ADD COLUMN flightlog_id uuid REFERENCES flightlog(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Extended type constraint
ALTER TABLE notifications
ADD CONSTRAINT notifications_type_check
CHECK (type IN (
  'document_uploaded',
  'document_approved',
  'document_rejected',
  'document_expiring',
  'flight_location_disconnect',
  'flight_overlap',
  'flight_warning'
));
```

## Notification Structure

When a flight is created with warnings, notifications are created with:
```typescript
{
  user_id: <board_member_id>,
  type: 'flight_warning',
  title: 'Flight Entry Needs Review',
  message: 'Flight entry for <TAIL_NUMBER> created with warnings: <WARNING_MESSAGES>',
  link: '/flightlog/<AIRCRAFT_ID>',
  flightlog_id: <CREATED_FLIGHT_ID>,
  read: false
}
```

## Visual Indicators

### Confirmation Modal Warnings
- Red alert box with AlertTriangle icon
- Lists all detected warnings as bullet points
- Clear call-to-action explaining consequences
- Positioned prominently above flight summary

### Flight Log List
- Red "Review" badge with AlertTriangle icon
- Shows before Locked/Charged badges
- Desktop: Full "Review" text
- Mobile: "!" icon only
- Clearly distinguishes entries needing attention

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Apply database migration successfully
- [ ] Create flight without warnings - should work normally
- [ ] Create flight with location disconnect - warning should appear
- [ ] Create flight with time overlap - warning should appear
- [ ] Create flight with both warnings - both should appear
- [ ] Confirm creation with warnings - entry should be created
- [ ] Verify `needs_board_review` flag is set to true
- [ ] Verify board members receive notifications
- [ ] Verify notification links to correct flight log page
- [ ] Verify red "Review" badge appears in flight list
- [ ] Edit existing entry - warnings should not reappear
- [ ] Verify board members can view/edit flagged entries

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Board Review Workflow**
   - Add "Approve" or "Reject" actions for board members
   - Clear `needs_board_review` flag after approval
   - Send notification back to pilot about resolution

2. **Warning Severity Levels**
   - Distinguish between critical warnings (blocking) and advisory warnings
   - Different colors/icons for different severity levels

3. **Automatic Fixes**
   - Suggest correct departure ICAO based on previous flight
   - Highlight time conflicts visually on calendar/schedule

4. **Warning History**
   - Log which warnings were overridden
   - Show warning history in entry details
   - Track who approved/resolved warnings

5. **Configurable Warning Rules**
   - Allow admin to enable/disable specific warning types
   - Configure time thresholds for overlaps
   - Set location disconnect tolerance (same airport groups)

## Support
